# LangRS Segmentation Demo

This Hugging Face Space demonstrates LangRS, a Python package that performs remote sensing segmentation from text prompts using Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Upload a satellite or aerial image, enter a natural language prompt (e.g., "crops", "buildings", "cars"), and view the resulting segmentation.
